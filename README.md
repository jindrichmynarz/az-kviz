# az-kviz

[Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io) view component for [AZ-kv√≠z](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ-kv%C3%ADz) board.

## Usage

Include as a dependency: `[net.mynarz.az-kviz "0.1.0"]`

Require the component `net.mynarz.az-kviz.view/board`. When you call it, you need to provide it two arguments: configuration and board state.

The configuration allows you to customize how the boards looks and behaves. You can see the default values of the configuration in `net.mynarz.az-kviz.view/board-config`. The most important of it is `[:tile-config :on-click]`, where you can provide a function that handles clicks on the board tiles. The function's argument is the ID of the clicked tile, which corresponds to the tile's index in the board state.

The board state represents the state of a game. You can get an initial board state by `net.mynarz.az-kviz.core/init-board-state`, and probably store it in a Reagent atom. The board state is a collection of tile states, each tracking the tile's `:status` and `:text` the tile shows.
